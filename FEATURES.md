# Aether — Feature Overview

> Each module inherits a shared Cognitive Protocol that enforces elemental analysis, adversarial reasoning, and structured output — no generic chatbot responses. All AI output requires attorney review before use.

## Core Platform

### Case Management
Organize cases with full party tracking, document management, timeline events, and notes. Cases can be archived (soft-delete) from the Matters view and restored or permanently deleted from Settings > Archived Matters. Multi-firm architecture with per-case data separation — all queries filtered by the authenticated user's firmId. Role fields (Admin / Member / Viewer) are stored per user; currently, only case deletion is restricted to Admin role. Other RBAC enforcement is on the roadmap.

### Document Intelligence
Upload and analyze legal documents using document text extraction and AI-assisted analysis. Supports PDFs, Office documents (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, RTF), and text files up to 50MB. Unsupported file types are rejected at upload with a clear error message. On upload, documents are processed through an asynchronous background pipeline: text extraction, AI-powered analysis, timeline event creation, and vector embedding generation. Documents are categorized and stored on NAS-mounted persistent storage. All uploaded documents become part of the case context available to every AI module.

### Semantic Search (RAG)
All uploaded documents are chunked into semantically meaningful segments and embedded as 768-dimensional vectors using Google's embedding model. When any AI module processes a query, the system retrieves the most relevant document chunks via cosine similarity search (pgvector), injecting source material into the AI context. This grounds AI responses in the actual case record rather than relying solely on model knowledge.

### Executive Case Brief
One-screen summary answering five questions about any case: What's the posture? What deadlines are critical? Where does discovery stand? What are the risk signals? What needs attention? Aggregates case data (status, jurisdiction, court, judge), upcoming deadlines with countdown, discovery metrics, document breakdown by category, party summary, risk signals (overdue deadlines, unverified events), and recent activity — all without an AI call (pure data aggregation for instant response).

### Timeline Tracking
Chronological event management with three display modes: Timeline (chronological stream), Month Calendar, and Week Calendar. Events can be marked as verified or unverified, tagged by type (free-form string, commonly: filing, hearing, deposition, deadline, document, general), and surfaced in case briefings. Auto-extracted events are linked to their source document via `sourceDocumentId`. Deadline events drive urgency signals in case briefings. Calendar views provide spatial awareness of event density and deadline proximity.

**Current limitations:** Extracted events link to the source document but do not store page numbers, source quotes, or confidence scores. Verification is a boolean toggle — no reviewer identity or timestamp is recorded. These are on the roadmap.

## AI Intelligence Modules

> All AI modules are decision-support tools. Output is generated by LLMs and must be reviewed, verified, and validated by a qualified attorney before any use in legal proceedings. Nothing generated by Aether constitutes legal advice.

### Case Chat Assistant
Context-aware chat powered by case data. The assistant has access to all documents, parties, events, and notes for the active case. Conversation history is persisted per-case with automatic summarization — a sliding window of recent messages is maintained alongside AI-generated summaries of older conversations, enabling continuity across sessions without unbounded context growth. Jurisdiction constraints are included in the system prompt to scope responses to applicable law.

### War Room — Strategic Analysis
Structured SWOT analysis that outputs JSON with:
- **Strengths / Weaknesses / Opportunities / Threats** — categorized strategic assessment
- **Executive Summary** — high-level case posture
- **Recommended Actions** — prioritized with deadlines
- **Discovery Suggestions** — areas to investigate
- **Settlement Considerations** — BATNA and corridor analysis

Output is AI-generated based on case data and RAG context. No external legal research is performed — citations in output are LLM-generated and must be independently verified. Supports iterative refinement via feedback loop.

### Red Team Audit
AI-generated vulnerability analysis simulating opposing counsel's perspective. Outputs a structured Vulnerability Matrix as JSON:
- **Overall Threat Level** — CRITICAL / HIGH / MODERATE / LOW
- **Case Fatality Rating** — 0-100 scale
- **Vulnerability entries** across six categories: credibility, evidence, procedural, legal, damages, narrative
- Each vulnerability includes severity, exploit strategy, recommended defense, and referenced case law
- **Summary Attack Plan** and **Immediate Actions**

Referenced case law is LLM-generated and not verified against external databases. Supports iterative refinement via feedback loop.

### Discovery Generator
Generates draft discovery requests based on case context:
- **Interrogatories** — draft written questions with strategic purpose annotations
- **Requests for Production** — document demand drafts
- **Requests for Admission** — statements requiring admit/deny responses
- Each request includes its strategic purpose

Output is structured JSON rendered in the UI. No export to DOCX/PDF — output must be copied and formatted by the attorney. All generated requests require review for compliance with applicable rules.

### Document Drafting
AI-generated draft text for motions, briefs, and correspondence. The system accepts document type, instructions, and optional prior draft for iterative refinement.

**What it is:** A draft generation assistant that produces formatted markdown text based on case context and user instructions.

**What it is not:** An automated document production system. There is no export to DOCX/PDF, no version history, and no template library. Output must be copied, reviewed, reformatted, and filed by the attorney.

### Citation Verification
LLM-based plausibility check for legal citations. Each citation is evaluated for:
- Whether the case name, volume, reporter, page, court, and year are plausible
- Whether the described holding is consistent with known law
- Confidence rating: verified / suspicious / likely fabricated / unable to verify

**Important limitation:** This is LLM self-assessment, not external database verification. The system does not query Westlaw, LexisNexis, or any legal database. It checks whether citations are plausible based on the model's training data. "Verified" means the LLM is confident the citation exists — it does not guarantee accuracy. All citations must be independently verified through authoritative legal research tools before filing.

## Simulation Modules

### Hearing Simulator
Practice oral arguments against an AI judge or opposing counsel persona. The user inputs arguments via voice or text; the AI responds in character. Maintains a running transcript within the session. Voice input uses OpenAI Whisper for speech-to-text transcription.

**Limitations:** No performance scoring or evaluation metrics. No transcript export. This is a conversational practice tool, not a graded simulation. Voice recording requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`; if not configured, the mic button is disabled and text input remains available as fallback.

### Deposition Simulator
Practice depositions with an AI-generated opposing counsel who asks hostile questions. The user responds via voice or text; the AI generates follow-up questions that probe inconsistencies.

**Limitations:** No scoring or export. Session transcripts are maintained in component state only (not persisted to database). Voice recording requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`; if not configured, text input only.

## Analysis Tools

### Settlement Analysis Assistant
AI-generated settlement scenario discussion based on case context. Outputs a structured range with supporting rationale. This is an LLM-generated discussion aid, not actuarial analysis or financial advice — it should inform conversation, not replace professional judgment.

### Privilege Scanner
AI-based scan of document text for attorney-client privilege and work product indicators. Flags potentially protected content before production. This is a first-pass screening tool — flagged items require attorney review to confirm privilege claims.

---

## Document Processing Pipeline

Every document upload triggers an asynchronous background pipeline with tracked job lifecycle (queued → processing → completed/failed):

1. **Job Creation** — A `DocumentJob` record is created and the job ID returned to the client for status polling
2. **Text Extraction** — Content is extracted from PDF, Office documents, and text files
3. **AI Analysis** — The extracted text is analyzed for key facts, legal issues, and relevant entities
4. **Timeline Event Creation** — Dates and events identified in the document are added to the case timeline with a link to the source document
5. **Vector Embedding** — The document is split into chunks (sentence-boundary-aware) and each chunk is embedded as a 768-dimensional vector for RAG retrieval

**Current limitations:** No retry mechanism for failed jobs. No granular progress tracking (status is binary: processing or done). No page-level traceability — extracted events link to the document but not to specific pages or quotes within it. These are on the roadmap.

---

## Conversation Memory

The Case Chat Assistant maintains persistent conversation memory per case:

- **Sliding Window** — Recent messages are maintained in full fidelity for immediate context
- **Automatic Summarization** — When conversations exceed the window, older messages are summarized by the AI and stored as compressed context
- **Cross-Session Continuity** — Summaries persist across sessions, so the assistant retains awareness of prior discussions without consuming unbounded context

---

## Security & Infrastructure

- **Identity proxy** — Authentik SSO with Traefik ForwardAuth on every request. Header-based auth — the API trusts identity headers from the upstream proxy. No JWT signature verification or HMAC at the application layer
- **Per-case data separation** — all database queries filtered by firmId
- **Action audit logging** — logs user, action, resource, resource ID, IP, user agent, and timestamp. Does not capture before/after state values
- **Multi-model AI with fallback** — Gemini primary, local Ollama fallback ensures availability
- **API rate limiting** — per-model sliding-window throttling with FIFO queues, graceful Ollama fallback on limit exhaustion
- **Containerized deployment** — deployed behind an identity proxy

---

## Known Limitations

- **No export** — AI-generated drafts, discovery requests, and analysis output can only be viewed in the UI. No DOCX, PDF, or file download capability
- **No version history** — Drafts and analyses are not versioned. Iterative refinement replaces the previous output
- **No external legal research** — Citation verification and case law references are LLM-generated, not sourced from legal databases
- **Limited RBAC enforcement** — Role field exists but only case deletion checks for Admin role. Viewer restrictions are not enforced
- **No page-level traceability** — Document chunks and extracted events lack page numbers and source quotes
- **No verification audit trail** — Event verification is a boolean toggle with no record of who verified or when
- **No job retries** — Failed document processing jobs must be re-triggered manually by re-uploading
- **Audit log captures actions, not state** — No before/after values recorded
- **Voice input requires API key** — Voice recording in simulators requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`; if not configured, text input only

---

## Roadmap

Items planned but not yet implemented:

- Page-level source traceability (page numbers, extracted quotes, confidence scores on events)
- Verification audit trail (verifiedBy, verifiedAt fields)
- DOCX/PDF export for drafts and discovery output
- Draft version history
- Full RBAC enforcement (Viewer read-only, Member restricted mutations)
- Audit log state capture (old/new values on mutations)

| Jurisdiction | Court System |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Florida** | 9th Circuit — Orange County |
| **Georgia** | Superior Court — Fulton County |
| **New York** | US District Court — Southern District |
| **Texas** | District Court — Harris County |
