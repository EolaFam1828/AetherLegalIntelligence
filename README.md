## What Is Aether?

Aether is an internal workflow support system for document organization, summarization, and drafting assistance. It is not a legal research tool or a substitute for an attorney. All outputs are draft or decision-support materials that require independent review.

## Core Capabilities

### 21 Integrated Modules

<details>
<summary><strong>View all 21 modules</strong> — Click to expand the full capabilities table</summary>

<br />

| Module | Capability | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Case Chat Assistant** | Context-aware chat with case data access — documents, parties, events, notes — plus RAG-powered document retrieval and persistent conversation memory | Operational |
| **War Room** | Structured SWOT analysis: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats, recommended actions, settlement considerations | Operational |
| **Red Team Audit** | AI-generated vulnerability matrix — severity scoring, exploit strategies, recommended defenses, referenced case law | Operational |
| **Discovery Generator** | Draft interrogatories, RFPs, and RFAs with strategic purpose annotations (attorney review and formatting required) | Operational |
| **Document Drafting** | AI-generated draft text for motions, briefs, and correspondence — iterative refinement supported, versioned via intelligence persistence (no export) | Operational |
| **Citation Verification** | LLM-based plausibility check for legal citations — flags suspicious or likely fabricated references (not external database verification). Citations persisted with status tracking | Operational |
| **Hearing Simulator** | Practice oral arguments against an AI judge or opposing counsel persona with voice or text input (OpenAI Whisper transcription). Sessions persisted with transcript and coaching notes | Operational |
| **Deposition Simulator** | Practice depositions against hostile AI opposing counsel with voice or text input (OpenAI Whisper transcription). Sessions persisted with transcript history | Operational |
| **Settlement Analysis Assistant** | AI-generated settlement scenario discussion with supporting rationale — not financial or legal advice | Operational |
| **Privilege Scanner** | AI-based first-pass scan for attorney-client privilege and work product indicators | Operational |
| **Document Intelligence** | Document text extraction and AI-assisted analysis (PDF, Office, text), with automatic timeline event creation, party extraction, and vector embedding. Unsupported file types rejected at upload | Operational |
| **Semantic Search** | RAG pipeline — cosine similarity search across all case documents for context-aware AI responses | Operational |
| **Executive Case Brief** | One-screen posture summary: status, deadlines, discovery status, document breakdown, risk signals, party management (pure data aggregation, no AI call) | Operational |
| **Timeline Tracking** | Chronological event management with timeline, month calendar, and week calendar views — deadline alerting and source document linking | Operational |
| **Case Management** | Per-case data separation with party tracking (auto-populated from case titles and document analysis), document management, notes, and case archiving (soft-delete with restore) | Operational |
| **Intelligence Persistence** | All AI module outputs versioned as CaseAnalysis records with input hash deduplication, staleness detection, and cross-module dependency tracking | Operational |
| **Case Signals** | Pre-computed case health metrics (overdue deadlines, unverified events, risk levels) injected into every AI prompt and used for staleness detection | Operational |
| **Recalibration Engine** | Reactive staleness detection — when case data changes, affected analyses are automatically flagged as stale with severity levels (minor, stale, critical) | Operational |
| **Case Theory Map** | Maps legal claims to required elements, elements to supporting/contradicting evidence, and evidence to source documents — exposing gaps where required elements lack proof. Outputs structured JSON with coherence scoring, critical gaps, and recommended evidence to obtain | Operational |
| **Key Exhibits** | Catalogs and analyzes the most critical evidence in a case — relevance ranking, authentication assessment, opposing objections, and trial preparation priority. Maps each exhibit to the claims and elements it supports | Operational |
| **Knowledge Graph** | Lightweight directed graph of relationships between case entities (supports, contradicts, mentions) written by AI modules and queryable via API | Operational |

## System Architecture

Multi-model AI engine with task-based routing, RAG-powered semantic search, conversation memory with automatic summarization, per-case data separation, SSO authentication, action audit logging, and a full intelligence persistence layer with versioned analyses, signal-driven staleness detection, cross-module context assembly, and a knowledge graph. Containerized service deployed behind an identity proxy.

> **[Full architecture with diagrams -> ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** — system overview, intelligence layer, AI engine, RAG pipeline, data model (25 models ERD), 66-endpoint API surface, security model, deployment topology, and design decisions.

## What It Does NOT Do

> [!WARNING]
> **Important Limitations:**

| Limitation | Reality |
|-----------|---------|
| **Not a lawyer** | All output requires attorney review before any use in legal proceedings |
| **No external legal research** | Citation verification is LLM-based plausibility checking, not Westlaw/LexisNexis lookup |
| **No document export** | AI-generated drafts and analyses are viewable in the UI only — no DOCX or PDF download |
| **No page-level traceability** | Extracted events link to source documents but not to specific pages or quotes |
| **Analysis versioning is backend-only** | Version chains exist in the database but UI doesn't expose version history navigation |
| **Limited access control** | Auth is header-based via identity proxy — minimal RBAC enforcement |
| **No job retries** | Failed document processing jobs must be re-triggered by re-uploading |

## About

**Jake Sadoway** — Stetson University '21, Orlando FL

Jake Sadoway is a litigation intelligence systems designer focused on retrieval, synthesis, and evidence workflows for complex matters. He builds tools that convert messy, high-volume case materials into structured, queryable knowledge. Pleadings, discovery, expert reports, transcripts, internal communications, and chronology all become connected artifacts rather than scattered files. His approach prioritizes traceability, security-minded architecture, and human verification. The objective is simple. Reduce time-to-understanding and increase confidence in what the record actually supports.
