# Aether — Litigation Intelligence Platform

**AI-assisted case intelligence for complex litigation.** Aether processes raw litigation data — pleadings, depositions, discovery productions, expert reports — into structured, AI-generated analysis for attorney review.

> All AI output is decision-support material. Nothing generated by Aether constitutes legal advice. Attorney review is required before any use in legal proceedings.

**This repository contains documentation, architecture diagrams, and design artifacts for the Aether litigation intelligence system. It does not include the production application or deployable services. The working system is privately hosted and demonstrated live upon request. This repo is intended as a technical portfolio and design reference only.**

---

## Intended Use

Aether is an internal workflow support system for document organization, summarization, and drafting assistance. It is not a legal research tool or a substitute for an attorney. All outputs are draft or decision-support materials that require independent review.

## What It Does

| Module | Capability |
|--------|-----------|
| **Case Chat Assistant** | Context-aware chat with case data access — documents, parties, events, notes — plus RAG-powered document retrieval and persistent conversation memory |
| **War Room** | Structured SWOT analysis: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats, recommended actions, settlement considerations |
| **Red Team Audit** | AI-generated vulnerability matrix — severity scoring, exploit strategies, recommended defenses, referenced case law |
| **Discovery Generator** | Draft interrogatories, RFPs, and RFAs with strategic purpose annotations (attorney review and formatting required) |
| **Document Drafting** | AI-generated draft text for motions, briefs, and correspondence — iterative refinement supported, versioned via intelligence persistence (no export) |
| **Citation Verification** | LLM-based plausibility check for legal citations — flags suspicious or likely fabricated references (not external database verification). Citations persisted with status tracking |
| **Hearing Simulator** | Practice oral arguments against an AI judge or opposing counsel persona with voice or text input (OpenAI Whisper transcription). Sessions persisted with transcript and coaching notes |
| **Deposition Simulator** | Practice depositions against hostile AI opposing counsel with voice or text input (OpenAI Whisper transcription). Sessions persisted with transcript history |
| **Settlement Analysis Assistant** | AI-generated settlement scenario discussion with supporting rationale — not financial or legal advice |
| **Privilege Scanner** | AI-based first-pass scan for attorney-client privilege and work product indicators |
| **Document Intelligence** | Document text extraction and AI-assisted analysis (PDF, Office, text), with timeline event creation and vector embedding. Unsupported file types rejected at upload |
| **Semantic Search** | RAG pipeline — cosine similarity search across all case documents for context-aware AI responses |
| **Executive Case Brief** | One-screen posture summary: status, deadlines, discovery status, document breakdown, risk signals (pure data aggregation, no AI call) |
| **Timeline Tracking** | Chronological event management with timeline, month calendar, and week calendar views — deadline alerting and source document linking |
| **Case Management** | Per-case data separation with party tracking, document management, notes, and case archiving (soft-delete with restore) |
| **Intelligence Persistence** | All AI module outputs versioned as CaseAnalysis records with input hash deduplication, staleness detection, and cross-module dependency tracking |
| **Case Signals** | Pre-computed case health metrics (overdue deadlines, unverified events, risk levels) injected into every AI prompt and used for staleness detection |
| **Recalibration Engine** | Reactive staleness detection — when case data changes, affected analyses are automatically flagged as stale with severity levels (minor, stale, critical) |
| **Knowledge Graph** | Lightweight directed graph of relationships between case entities (supports, contradicts, mentions) written by AI modules and queryable via API |

## Architecture

Multi-model AI engine with task-based routing, RAG-powered semantic search, conversation memory with automatic summarization, per-case data separation, SSO authentication, action audit logging, and a full intelligence persistence layer with versioned analyses, signal-driven staleness detection, cross-module context assembly, and a knowledge graph. Containerized service deployed behind an identity proxy.

> **[System architecture with diagrams](ARCHITECTURE.md)** — includes data model, AI engine, RAG pipeline, request lifecycle, security model, and deployment topology.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS |
| Backend | Express.js, TypeScript, Prisma ORM (25 models, 63 endpoints) |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16, pgvector extension |
| AI (Primary) | Google Gemini Pro (strategy, audit, drafting) · Gemini Flash (chat, simulation) |
| AI (Fallback) | Ollama + Llama 3.1 — local inference when Gemini is unavailable |
| Embeddings | Google Embedding API (768-dimensional vectors) |
| Transcription | OpenAI Whisper API (whisper-1) — voice input for simulators |
| Intelligence | Versioned analysis persistence, signal computation, recalibration engine, knowledge graph, input hash deduplication |
| Auth | Authentik SSO via Traefik ForwardAuth (header-based, no JWT) |
| Infrastructure | Containerized, deployed behind an identity proxy |

## What It Does NOT Do

- **Not a lawyer.** All output requires attorney review. No AI-generated content should be filed or relied upon without independent verification.
- **No external legal research.** Citation verification is LLM-based plausibility checking, not Westlaw/LexisNexis lookup. "Verified" means the LLM is confident, not that the citation is confirmed.
- **No document export.** AI-generated drafts, discovery requests, and analyses are viewable in the UI only — no DOCX or PDF download.
- **No page-level traceability.** Extracted events link to source documents but not to specific pages or quotes within them.
- **Analysis versioning is backend-only.** AI analyses are versioned in the database with full version chains, but the UI does not yet expose version history navigation or diff views.
- **Limited access control.** Auth is header-based via identity proxy — no application-layer JWT or HMAC verification. RBAC roles are stored but enforcement is minimal.
- **No job retries.** Failed document processing jobs must be re-triggered by re-uploading.

## Repository Structure

This is a **public portfolio showcase**. It contains architecture documentation, system design diagrams, and feature descriptions. The full production source code is maintained in a private repository and is available for live demonstration upon request.

## About

Designed and built by **Jake Sadoway** — Stetson University '21, Orlando FL. Background in institutional development, grants compliance, and AI-driven workflow automation.

This project demonstrates that litigation intelligence is a tractable engineering problem: raw case data in, structured analysis out — with the attorney always in the loop.
