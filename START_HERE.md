## What Is Aether?

Aether is an **AI-assisted litigation intelligence platform** that processes raw case data — pleadings, depositions, discovery productions, expert reports — into structured, AI-generated analysis for attorney review.

### Core Capabilities (17 Modules)

- **Case Chat Assistant** — Context-aware chat with RAG-powered document retrieval
- **War Room** — Strategic SWOT analysis with recommended actions
- **Red Team Audit** — AI-generated vulnerability matrix with severity scoring
- **Discovery Generator** — Draft interrogatories, RFPs, and RFAs
- **Document Drafting** — AI-generated draft text for motions and briefs
- **Citation Verification** — LLM-based plausibility check for legal citations
- **Hearing/Deposition Simulators** — Practice arguments with AI opposing counsel
- **Settlement Analysis** — AI-generated settlement scenario discussion
- **Privilege Scanner** — AI-based first-pass scan for protected content
- **Document Intelligence** — Text extraction and AI analysis of uploaded files
- **Semantic Search** — RAG pipeline with cosine similarity search
- **Executive Case Brief** — One-screen posture summary (pure data aggregation)
- **Timeline Tracking** — Chronological event management with calendar views
- **Case Management** — Per-case data separation with archiving
- **Intelligence Persistence** — Versioned analyses with input hash deduplication
- **Case Signals** — Pre-computed health metrics injected into AI prompts
- **Recalibration Engine** — Reactive staleness detection for analyses
- **Knowledge Graph** — Lightweight directed graph of case entity relationships

> **Important:** All AI output is decision-support material. Nothing generated by Aether constitutes legal advice. Attorney review is required before any use in legal proceedings.

## Tech Stack Summary

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS |
| **Backend** | Express.js, TypeScript, Prisma ORM (25 models, 63 endpoints) |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL 16, pgvector extension |
| **AI (Primary)** | Google Gemini Pro (strategy, audit, drafting) · Gemini Flash (chat, simulation) |
| **AI (Fallback)** | Ollama + Llama 3.1 — local inference |
| **Embeddings** | Google Embedding API (768-dimensional vectors) |
| **Transcription** | OpenAI Whisper API (whisper-1) |
| **Auth** | Authentik SSO via Traefik ForwardAuth |
| **Infrastructure** | Containerized, deployed behind an identity proxy |

## What It Does NOT Do

- **Not a lawyer.** All output requires attorney review.
- **No external legal research.** Citation verification is LLM-based plausibility checking, not database lookup.
- **No document export.** AI-generated drafts and analyses are viewable in the UI only — no DOCX or PDF download.
- **No page-level traceability.** Extracted events link to documents but not to specific pages.
- **Analysis versioning is backend-only.** Version chains exist in the database but UI doesn't expose version history navigation.
- **Limited access control.** Auth is header-based via identity proxy — minimal RBAC enforcement.
- **No job retries.** Failed document processing jobs must be re-triggered by re-uploading.
